## EMBC 2019

[Homepage](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8856999)

EMBC hosted by IEEE, but more focus on the biomedical inforamtion, not medical image.

1. U-NetPlus: A Modified Encoder-Decoder U-Net Architecture for Semantic and Instance Segmentation of Surgical Instruments from Laparoscopic Images [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10/ggj492).

2. Using a Motion Capture System as Reference for Motion Tracking in Photoplethysmography Imaging. [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10/ggj49z).
